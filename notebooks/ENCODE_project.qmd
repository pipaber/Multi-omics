# Introduction

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ([ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/)) is a collection of experimental results (from human, mouse, worm and fly) and computing resources devoted to elaborating the mechanisms of gene regulation.

We will use Bioconductor to acquire and interpret ENCODE resources. In particular, we'll analyze ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq and CRISPR interference RNA-Seq experiments.
