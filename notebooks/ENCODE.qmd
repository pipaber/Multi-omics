## Introduction

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) is a collection of experimental results (from human, mouse, worm and fly) and computing resources devoted to elaborating the mechanisms of gene regulation. The [ENCODE webpage](https://www.encodeproject.org/) provides a good overview of the project scope involving dozens of biotechnological innovations that are used to analyze gene structure and regulation.

We will analyze data from ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq and CRISPR interference RNA-Seq experiments to show how to use ENCODE with R.
