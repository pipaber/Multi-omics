    "The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) is a collection of experimental results (from human, mouse, worm and fly) and computing resources devoted to elaborating the mechanisms of gene regulation. The [ENCODE webpage](https://www.encodeproject.org/) provides a good overview of the project scope involving dozens of biotechnological innovations that are used to analyze gene structure and regulation.\n",
